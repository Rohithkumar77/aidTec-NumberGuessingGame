TASK 1:
Number Guessing Game


Features:
  • The game should have a clean and user-friendly interface.
  • It should allow users to input their name and start the game.
  • It should generate a random number between 1 and 100.
  • It should allow users to guess the number within 10 attempts. It should provide feedback to the user after each guess, letting them know if their guess was too high or       too low.
  • It should declare the user as the winner if they guess the number correctly.
  • It should give the user the option to play again or quit the game.
  
  
Steps to create the project:
  1. Open a new Python file in your favorite text editor or IDE.
  2. Write a welcome message to the user, asking them for their name and explaining the rules of the game.
  3. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 using the random module. 
  4. Use a loop to allow the user to input their guess within 10 attempts..
  5. Compare the user's guess with the random number and provide feedback to the user, letting them know if their guess was too high or too low.
  6. If the user guesses the number correctly within the 10 attempts, declare them the winner and ask if they want to play again. 7.If the user doesn't guess the number          correctly within the 10 attempts, declare the game over and ask if
    they want to play again. 8. Test the game by running the Python file in your terminal or console.
